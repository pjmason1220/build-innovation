Subject: Innovation Capability Research - 30 min conversation?

Hi [Name],

I'm PJ Mason - I spent 14 years leading design and innovation at P&G, where I built their first Digital Design Capability from scratch and led platforms like Oral-B iO (German Design Award Gold, $100M+ growth impact).

I'm currently researching how mid-market and large companies like Cintas are thinking about building internal design and innovation capabilities - specifically the balance between developing in-house expertise versus relying on external resources.

Cintas's scale and product diversity create interesting innovation challenges. Would you be open to a 30-minute conversation? I'm not selling anything right now - genuinely trying to understand the landscape from innovation leaders like yourself.

Happy to share what I'm learning from other companies tackling similar challenges.

Best,

Subject: P&G design alum - innovation capability conversation?

Hi Dan,

I'm PJ Mason - recently wrapped up 14 years at P&G where I was Senior Director of Design for Oral Care & Smart Products. I built P&G's first Digital Design Capability and led platforms responsible for $100M+ in growth (including Oral-B iO).

I came across Nehemiah's story and was impressed by your mission-driven approach and P&G partnership with Kandoo. As you continue growing your brand portfolio, I'm curious how you're thinking about building design and innovation capabilities internally.
